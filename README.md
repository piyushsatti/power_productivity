# power_productivity
All in one productivity tracker. Combines streak-like-tracker, KanBan, and pomodoro. Provides productivity data analytics.

# Key Idea
Combines the following:
- [Kanban](https://kanbanflow.com/)
- [Pomodoro](https://pomofocus.io/)
- [DailyHabits](https://app.dailyhabits.xyz/)

Tracks time spent on a project along the entire verticle. Shows in-depth data analytics of the work done, its distibution and the # of features pushed in a specific period of time.

# Design Goals
- Usable Application
- 

# Tech Stack
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node

Should focus on the frontend implementation. UI should be usable enough that *I* would like to use the tool. Needs to be deployed on digital ocean.
